# paivy-file-1
## My first github repo
ls - used to list number of files in a directory
pwd - used to show the current location in a directory
cd - is used to move to a specific directoryor rather change from one directory to another
touch -it  is used to create an empty file with nothing witten on it for example paivy.txt was the empty file i created
nano- it provides a notebook where you can input text on the empty file created.So it helped me write the words I am cool I love linux
